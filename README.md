# FriendFinder

Created during Week 7 of UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp. The goal was to create a Friend Finder app (essentially a dating app but for friends) 
using Node and Express servers. The user enters the page that leads to a survey. When the user submits the survey, they are matched with
a "friend" that has the closest match to their personality.
